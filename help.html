    <h2>What can you do to avoid impending doom?</h2>
    <p>Just because the chances are slim that we can survive on this planet doesn't mean we should just give up on it! <br></p>
    <p>Building a global economy capable of supporting interstellar travel and terraforming on a planatery scale is going to take alot of work. </p>
    <p>There are multiple things you, as a consumer and a human being, can do to try to give us as much time as we can to get the hell out of dodge.</p>

Are you an engineer? a physicist? an eccentric billionaire? Then work the problem! The film Moon had an interesting idea involving helium-3 and cold fusion. </p>

      <p class="card-text">Overpopulation is always the elephant in the room. Everyone admits it's a problem but very rarely do we delve into how MUCH of a problem it is. If our birthrates stay unchecked it will be the death of us. Climate change or not, we will run out of space and food eventually. So for now maybe come to grips with the realisation that we don't need to make babies anymore, maybe put a condom on. Maybe, on a cloudless night, look up and realise that our future is out there.</p>
